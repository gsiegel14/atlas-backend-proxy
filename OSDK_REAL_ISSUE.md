# OSDK Real Issue - Corrected Analysis

## ✅ Configuration Is Correct

Based on your Foundry console screenshot:

- **RID**: `ri.ontology.main.ontology.8208fd4c-b7fb-45ef-bf49-99a402136e58` ✅
- **API name**: `ontology-151e0d3d-719c-464d-be5c-a6dc9f53d194` ✅

These are **two identifiers for the SAME ontology** - your configuration is correct!

## Real Problem: OSDK Client Is Failing to Initialize

Looking at your logs:
```json
{"error":"not implemented","level":"warn","message":"OSDK client initialization failed"}
{"error":"not implemented","level":"warn","message":"OSDK failed for dashboard profile, trying REST API fallback"}
```

The error `"not implemented"` suggests one of these issues:

### 1. OSDK Client Not Properly Initialized
From `src/osdk/client.js` lines 69-114, the client is created but might be failing silently.

### 2. Missing Object Type Definition
The OSDK client needs the actual TypeScript SDK generated for your ontology. From the Foundry example:

```typescript
import { FastenClinicalNotes } from "@atlas-dev/sdk";
```

**You need to:**
1. Generate the TypeScript SDK for your ontology
2. Import the object types (like `AtlasCarePatientProfile`)
3. Use them with the OSDK client

### 3. Current Code Is Using Generic String Access
In `patient.js` line 156:
```javascript
const patientObjects = osdkClient('A');  // This might not work without SDK
```

This generic string-based access might not be supported. You need:
```javascript
import { A } from "@your-org/atlas-sdk";
const patientObjects = osdkClient(A);
```

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Generate Your Ontology SDK

From Foundry Console:
1. Go to your ontology (`Atlas Engine Ontology`)
2. Navigate to **Developer Console** → **TypeScript SDK**
3. Click **Generate SDK**
4. Download or set up npm package

### Step 2: Install the Generated SDK

```bash
cd backend-proxy
npm install @atlas-dev/sdk
# OR if it's a local package:
# npm install /path/to/generated/sdk
```

### Step 3: Import Object Types

Update `src/osdk/client.js`:
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@osdk/client';
import { createConfidentialOauthClient } from '@osdk/oauth';
// Import your generated SDK
import { A } from '@atlas-dev/sdk';  // Or whatever your package is named

// ... existing auth setup ...

const client = createClient(host, ontologyRid, tokenProvider);

// Export both client and object types
export { client, A, host as osdkHost, exportedOntologyRid as osdkOntologyRid };
```

### Step 4: Use Typed Object Access

Update `src/routes/patient.js`:
```javascript
import { client as osdkClient, A, osdkHost, osdkOntologyRid } from '../osdk/client.js';

// In the dashboard endpoint:
try {
  const patientObjects = osdkClient(A);  // Use imported type instead of string
  // ... rest of code
```

## Alternative: Keep Using REST API

The REST API fallback is working perfectly. If setting up the OSDK SDK is complex, you could:

1. **Remove OSDK attempts** and use REST API exclusively
2. **Keep current fallback pattern** (OSDK → REST API)
3. **Implement OSDK properly later** when you have time

The REST API is already working and cached, so this is not urgent.

## Quick Fix: Disable OSDK Temporarily

If you want to stop the "not implemented" warnings:

```bash
# Add to render.yaml
- key: OSDK_CLIENT_DISABLE
  value: "true"
```

This will bypass OSDK initialization and use REST API only (which is already working and cached).

## Recommendation

**For now**: Disable OSDK and use REST API (it's working great with caching)

**Later**: When you have time, properly generate and integrate the TypeScript SDK for better type safety and potentially better performance.
